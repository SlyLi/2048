## Total C with Win32 API

###    About half a year ago, I write this little game to show what I had learned in the summer vacation. I spent 7 days to finish it, and it was the largest program I had wrote before. 
###   But I haven't finish it exactly. In the first verison, I think what I need to add is a local storage function and a networking function. Sometime I will finish it, maybe.
